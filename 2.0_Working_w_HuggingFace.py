# MAGIC # Supplementary Examples on HuggingFace
# MAGIC HuggingfaceðŸ¤— provides a series of libraries that are critical in the OSS llm space\
# MAGIC To use them properly later on and debug issues we need to have an understand of how they work\
# MAGIC This is not a full tutorial. See HuggingFace docs for that. But it will function as a crash course.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In these exercises we will focus on the _transformers_ library but _datasets_, _evaluate_ and _accelerate_ are commonly used in training models. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC All code here is tested on MLR 13.3 LTS on a g5 AWS instance (A10G GPU) and also on m5.4xlarge for CPU version.
# MAGIC We suggest a ```g5.4xlarge``` single node cluster to start
# MAGIC The Azure equivalent is ```NC6s_v3``` series. However, for this lab we will be using ```g5.4xlarge``` instances.
# MAGIC ----
# MAGIC **Notes**
# MAGIC - Falcon requires Torch 2.0 which is available in MLR 14.x
# MAGIC - The LLM Space is fast moving. Many models are provided by independent companies as well so model revision and pinning library versions is important.
# MAGIC - If using an MLR prior to 13.2, you will need to run ```%pip install einops```
# MAGIC - It may also be necessary to manually install extra Nvidia libraries via [init_scripts](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/init-scripts.html)
# MAGIC - Sometimes huggingface complains about xformers you can add that install to the below pip command (```%pip install xformers```)

# MAGIC ### DBFS Cache
# MAGIC Configure databricks storage locations and caching. By default databricks uses dbfs to store information.\ 
# MAGIC HuggingFace will by default cache to a root path folder. We can change that so that we don't have to redownload if the cluster terminates.
# MAGIC [dbutils](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-utils.html) is a databricks utility for working with the object store tier.

# MAGIC ## HuggingFaceðŸ¤— Crash Course
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are a few key components that we need to construct an llm object that we can converse with.\
# MAGIC - [Tokenizers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer) in HuggingFaceðŸ¤—, the tokenizers are responsible for preparing text for input to transformer models. More technically, they are responsible for taking text and mapping them to a vector representation in integers (which can be interpretted by our models). We will explore this now...
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - [Models](https://huggingface.co/models) are pretrained versions of various transformer architectures that are used for different natural language processing tasks. They are encapsulations of complex neural networks, each with pre-trained weights that can either be used directly for inference or further fine-tuned on specific tasks. Each 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once we have the tokenizer and the model then we can put all into a pipeline\
# MAGIC Note with Huggingface components each object will have it's own configuration parameters. ie
# MAGIC - tokenizer configs
# MAGIC - model configs
# MAGIC - pipeline configs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One known issue is if you run the code that loads a model twice then it will not overwrite GPU memory.\
# MAGIC It will load the new copy in fresh memory and you can get an `Out of Memory` (OOM) error.\
# MAGIC The easiest fix is to [Detach & Attach](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#detach-a-notebook)
# MAGIC When loading models, setting the revision can be important to replicate behaviour. See: [HuggingFaceðŸ¤— Repository Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_sharing#repository-features) 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When working with standard model objects then it we can use all the normal APIs.\
# MAGIC But To make llms fast enough to run on CPU we need to leverage a couple of other opensource components.\
# MAGIC These are not standard huggingface components so work a bit differently.\
# MAGIC - [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml) Which is a specialised tensor library for fast inference.\ 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - [ctransformer](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) A wrapper for ggml to give it a python API 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The CPU version loads differently and we essentially get the model object straight away without having to define the tokenizer.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To ensure that we have consistency between CPU and GPU experiences, we will use the model - open-llama-7B-v2-open-instruct\
# MAGIC Since this is available in CPU optimized and GPU formats

# MAGIC ### Understanding Generation Config
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We created a `pipe` entity above. That can be used to generate output from our llm\
# MAGIC The syntax is: `output = pipe(<text input>, **kwargs)`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If you are using GPU then the output will be a list of dictionaries
# MAGIC If you are on CPU then the output will be a string
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Key Parameters**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **max_new_tokens**: Defines the maximum number of tokens produced during text generation. Useful for controlling the length of the output.
# MAGIC - **temperature**: Adjusts the randomness in the model's output. Lower values yield more deterministic results, higher values introduce more diversity.
# MAGIC - **repetition_penalty**: Some models will repeat themselves unless you set a repetition penalty

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md <img src="https://files.training.databricks.com/images/icon_note_32.png" alt="Note"> In the code below, we reference the ```repetition_penalty```. Is a parameter to penalise the model for repetition. ```1.0``` implies no penalty. This penalty is applied during the sampling phase by discounting the scores of previously generated tokens. In a greedy sampling scheme, this incentivies model exploration. Please see this paper for further details [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf).

# MAGIC # Picking a model
# MAGIC Whilst Model providers like Open-AI tend to have one generic model for all usecases, there is more nuance in OpenSource\
# MAGIC See: https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/large-language-models-oss-guidance
# MAGIC Different OSS Models have different things that they are trained on.\
# MAGIC Lets look at the [MPT models](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b) for example:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This model comes in the variants:
# MAGIC - Base
# MAGIC - StoryWriter
# MAGIC - Instruct
# MAGIC - Chat
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `Base` is the common root for the models. The others are built on top of this.\
# MAGIC `Instruct` is built to follow instructions as per the [following paper](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) \
# MAGIC At a high level we could say that OpenAI ChatGPT would more be a hybrid of Instruct and Chat rather than Base
