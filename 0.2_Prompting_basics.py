# MAGIC Prompt Engineering is a key part of work with LLMs\
# MAGIC It is how we can instruct a large language model to perform tasks, answer questions\
# MAGIC and a big part of building LLM Applications
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more details see: https://www.promptingguide.ai/
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can work with prompting within the playground interface as well \
# MAGIC That way you don't need to know code.

# MAGIC Chatting with a LLM is all well and good but you probably want to achieve something with this exchange!\
# MAGIC
# MAGIC A common application of LLMs is to use it for customer service. \ 
# MAGIC but rather than start with a full customer service experience, lets start with trying to judge the tone of customer feedback

# MAGIC # Understanding Evaluation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Large Language Models are complex and for real world use, you will need to do a lot of testing to make sure they behave the way that you want.\
# MAGIC Therefore, we need to run a lot of testing of  our LLM outputs to be sure of how they behave.\
# MAGIC Lets reconsider how we might assess the Telco Customer Service bot before:\
# MAGIC We need to look at:
# MAGIC - Did we provide the right reply?
# MAGIC - Was the reply in the tone that we want?
# MAGIC - Were we able to resist potential bad prompts?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The best way to do this at scale is to use LLMs to analyse the output of your bots and judge them. \
# MAGIC In Playground, you can already see automatic judge replies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Typically for a full application we will use code instead to run evaluations as a batch job.
