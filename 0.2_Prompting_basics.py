# MAGIC # Basic Prompting
# MAGIC Getting started is easy, we can send text in.
# MAGIC Remember that different models will respond differently!
# MAGIC The same model can also responds differently when we rerun a prompt
# MAGIC (though you likely only see this with basic one line prompts)

Based on the below context:

LK-99 is a potential room-temperature superconductor with a gray‒black appearance.[2]: 8  It has a hexagonal structure slightly modified from lead‒apatite, by introducing small amounts of copper. A room-temperature superconductor is a material that is capable of exhibiting superconductivity at operating temperatures above 0 °C (273 K; 32 °F), that is, temperatures that can be reached and easily maintained in an everyday environment.
